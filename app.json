    "description": "Hello, my name is Scott Getz and this is my Stackathon Project for FullStack Academy. I have a burning passion for cars, and the car community, so I really enjoyed developing this application. Motor-Fi is a react-native app that showcases my personal favorite cars. Motor-Fi allows users to scroll through the gallery of provided vehicles, view technical specs of those vehicles, as well as forums listing them for sale.",
